Arduino-network-relay
=====================

Control your electical devices through your local network or internet

This electronic circuit is based on Arduino nano platform, ENC28J60 ethernet module (or wiznet W5100 ethernet module) and AS2302 humidity / temperature sensor. The whole circuit is controlled via android application I wrote.
Moreover, the circuit has an isolated input for feedback from your remote control.

The android application can be found on Google play for free!
